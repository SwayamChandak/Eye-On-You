Time Counter (MV3)

Track how long you spend on each website (per domain). Tracking can be disabled/enabled only with the correct username and password.

Features
- Background service worker tracks active tab domain every second
- Ignores time when computer is idle or window minimized
- Popup shows per-domain totals; clear/reset and refresh
- Options page to set username and password (stored as salted SHA-256 hash)
- Lock/Unlock tracking from popup with authentication

Install (Chrome/Edge/Brave)
1. Download this folder to your computer.
2. Open browser to `chrome://extensions` (or equivalent).
3. Enable "Developer mode".
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder.

Usage
- Click the extension icon to open the popup and view time by domain.
- Open Options (right-click the icon â†’ Options) to set credentials.
- In the popup, enter credentials to Lock (disable) or Unlock (enable) tracking.

Notes
- Time is stored locally in `chrome.storage.local`.
- Password is never stored in plaintext; only salted hash is stored.
- This is not tamper-proof; anyone with file access to the extension folder can remove it or the storage. It's intended to prevent casual disabling from the UI.
